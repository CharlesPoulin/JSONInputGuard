1. **GJSON** - If you only need validation/querying
2. **JSONInputGuard** - If you need full struct unmarshaling + validation
3. **Jsoniter** - If you want drop-in stdlib replacement

### üéØ **For Memory-Constrained Environments**
1. **GJSON** - Minimal memory footprint
2. **JSONInputGuard** - Excellent memory efficiency with full features
3. **Standard Library** - Avoid for high-throughput scenarios

### üéØ **For Validation-Heavy Workloads**
1. **JSONInputGuard** - AST-based validation is very efficient
2. **GJSON** - Good for simple field checks
3. **Standard Library** - Full validation but slow

### üéØ **For Existing Codebases**
1. **Jsoniter** - Drop-in replacement
2. **JSONInputGuard** - If you can refactor for better performance
3. **Standard Library** - If performance isn't critical
